# Bad Translate for Python (Windows/Mac/Linux)
Will translate your input into random languages and back.  
Your result will be complete gibberish.  

## Requirements
- You will need Python 3.10 or 3.11 and the required modules!  
- It probably works in other versions too, but I only tested it in Python 3.10 and 3.11  

## Installing the modules:
1. Execute "Install required modules.pyw" (with py.exe) and skip to step 4  
   - OR if this doesn't work for you, got to step 2  
2. Needs to be executed in the current directory  

   Change the directory on Windows:  

   ```
   > cd <path to your current directory>
   ```
   ```
   > Example:
   > cd \Users\Simon\bad-translate-main\
   ```
3. Now execute the actual command (Windows, Mac, Linux):  
   ```
   > python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Just wait until the modules have installed and close the console window if it doesn't close automatically  

## How to use "Bad Translate":
- To start the program, open "app.py" (with py.exe) and follow the instructions shown in the console window  
- You will find all of your translated texts under the "results" folder and your input is stored under input.txt  
- *Have fun!*
